# ðŸŽ¯ Habit Tracker with Streaks (Streamlit)

A beautiful, motivating, and interactive web application to **track daily habits** and **build powerful completion streaks**. Built with Python and Streamlit, this app helps users maintain consistency and track progress toward long-term goals.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Custom Habit Creation:** Easily add new habits with custom names, target days (goals), and categories (Health, Learning, Fitness, etc.).
* **Dynamic Streak Counter:** The application dynamically calculates and displays the current **streak** (consecutive days completed) with motivational indicators (e.g., ðŸ”¥).
* **7-Day Visual Calendar:** Each habit card includes a clear visual calendar showing completion status for the last seven days, making consistency easy to spot.
* **Progress Tracking:** Displays a progress bar indicating how close the user is to their long-term **target day goals**.
* **Statistics Dashboard:** A header dashboard summarizes total ongoing streaks, habits completed today, and the number of active habits.
* **Persistence:** All habit data (including streaks and completed dates) is managed using **Streamlit Session State** for the duration of the session.
